This app enables two alwaysAI models to be used simultaneously: one to detect facial objects, and a second to classify the detected faces in terms of age ranges. 


To run this app, you will need an alwaysAI account. Please register at https://alwaysai.co/auth?register=true


Easy start up guides can be found following registration. Please see the docs page for more information: https://alwaysai.co/docs/getting_started/introduction.html


If you are having trouble connecting to your edge device, use the CLI configure command to reset the device. Please see the following page for more details: https://alwaysai.co/docs/reference/cli_commands.html


The age classifier used is the 'alwaysai/agenet' model, and more details can be found at https://alwaysai.co/model-catalog?model=alwaysai/agenet


The facial detection used is the 'alwaysai/res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000' model, and more details can be found at https://alwaysai.co/model-catalog?model=alwaysai/res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000


You can alter the code to used different detection and classification models: https://alwaysai.co/docs/application_development/changing_the_model.html
